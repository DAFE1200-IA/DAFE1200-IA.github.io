<!--Description of website:
Your friend Louise Park has been sewing colorful facemasks as a hobby project.
The masks are becoming very popular and the product demand is increasing.
She is asking you to help build her own webpage with the possibilities
for her costumers to buy her products online.

Create the underlying structure of the webpage with a menu on the top,
a product picture as a background and the logo “Face the mask” as the first thing you see.
Do also include a picture of Louise and some words that tells the costumers her story.

         <h4> ABOUT LOUISE</h4>
         <p>Louise has been an avid sewist for most of her life,
             and when she was put on temporary leave from her job due to COVID-19,
             Louise decided to contribute to the increasing demand for face masks by creating them herself.
             The masks are made from three layers of recycled cotton, and they have adjustable
             straps.
